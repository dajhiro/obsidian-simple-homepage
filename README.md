# Simple Homepage

A homepage plugin that behaves just like a web browser.

## Motivation

I use an index note as my homepage. I wanted this homepage feature to work the same way a web browser does, paired with a keyboard shortcut. A new tab and the homepage are separate concerns.

[obsidian-homepage](https://github.com/novov/obsidian-homepage) by novov likely already covers what most people need. This plugin, however, was built as one piece of a larger workflow I have in mind.

## Installation

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins**.
2. Select **Browse** and search for "Simple Homepage".
3. Select **Install**, then **Enable**.

## Usage

1. Open **Settings → Simple Homepage**.
2. Set **Path** to the note you want to use as your homepage.
3. Optionally, enable **Open on startup** to open the homepage automatically when Obsidian starts with an empty tab.
4. Use the **Open homepage** command (via the command palette or a keyboard shortcut), or select the ribbon icon, to open the homepage at any time.

## Features

### Current

- **Command** — Provides a command to open the homepage.
  - Running this command opens the homepage regardless of whether a tab with the homepage already open exists.
- **Open on startup** — Automatically opens the homepage when starting Obsidian with only an empty tab present.

### Ribbon Icon

- `Click` — Current
- `Shift-Click` — New window
- `Ctrl-Click` — New tab
- `Alt-Click` — New Split

## Todo: Done

- [x] Open the homepage when starting with an empty tab
- [x] Improve open performance
- [x] Add a ribbon icon with modifier-key open modes

## Todo

- [ ] `Ctrl-Click` — New tab (background, doesn't switch focus)
- [ ] `Ctrl-Shift-Click` — New tab (switches focus)
- [ ] `Right-Click` — Context menu (options / off)
  - Likely won't implement, depending on conventions from other core/community plugins.

## Acknowledgements

Inspired by [obsidian-homepage](https://github.com/novov/obsidian-homepage) by novov. As this is my first Obsidian plugin, I referenced novov's code quite a bit.
